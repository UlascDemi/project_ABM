# Project ABM, Optimal Positioning of First-Aid Responder

This model will help answer the question of what is the optimal positioning of placing first-aid workers during a concert in the Ziggo dome. This will be answered by simulating a crowd, with crowdlike behaviour and placing "accidents" scattered throughout the concerthall. The simulation will only take the standing area into account. The positioning of the first-aid workers will then be randomized and looked for an optimal positioning

To answer our head question we will first need to answer a few secondary questions. These questions are:
1. question 1
2. question 2
3. question 3
